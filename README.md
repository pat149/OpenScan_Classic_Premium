## Introduction and Changes
The intentions behind the redesign of the OpenScan Classic were that it seems it has never gotten out of it's prototype stage constructionwise.
So I made a list with things that should be improved.

- sturdier overall construction
- more convenient height adjustment
- use ball bearings instead of pins
- use heated inserts instead of driving the screw into the plastic
- higher modularity concerning the size of the scanner
- printing without any supports
