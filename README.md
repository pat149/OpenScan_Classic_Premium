## Introduction
The intentions behind the redesign of the OpenScan Classic were that it seems it has never gotten out of it's prototype stage constructionwise.
So I made a list with things that should be improved.

- sturdier overall construction
- more convenient height adjustment
- use ball bearings instead of pins
- use heated inserts instead of driving the screw into the plastic
- higher modularity concerning the size of the scanner
- cable management for the turntable stepper
- printing without any supports

So I redesigned the Classic version from scratch on and the result was the OpenScan Classic Premium (might change the name in the future). No parts of the original mainframe have been reused in order to make room for improvements while simultaneously keeping the original shape and functionality.
Because I don't use a PiCam I didn't redesigned the stand for the Raspberry Pi (yet).

## Print settings
Every printed part can be printed without any supports at all using the following print settings:
- 0.4mm nozzle
- 0.2mm layer height
- 3 walls (except for Turntable_Base, Turntable_Extension and Rotary_Arm: min. 5 walls, depending on the overall length)
- 15% infill
